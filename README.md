First thing to note regarding this challenge is i a kudos to Eric Wastl the creator of this event - [Aoc](https://adventofcode.com/2021/)

A couple of notes regarding this repo and event in general - 
* I sometimes did a bit of an edit on the input i.e. removing excess newlines and such
* Those are absolutely not the best nor the most efficient solutions for those problems
* If you have stumbled upon this repo out of the many thousands that exists regarding this event - Please solve the questions yourself, it's way more fun
